Solves a 3 by 3 Portel puzzle

Can be used to solve other puzzles with minor changes.

Human-readable format not (yet) implemented. The different borders of the tiles are numbered. Adjacent tile-borders should sum up to 9 in the example.

There is only one solution to the example puzzle (the others are just rotations of the same solution)

Enjoy making and solving your own puzzle!

The puzzle below was too hard for me to solve, so I asked the computer for help. If you could solve it yourself, congratulations!
